# React Games App

This is a simple React app that showcases two classic games: Pong and Snake. It allows users to navigate between the games and play them directly in the browser.

## Getting Started

To get started with the app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the dependencies by running the command: `npm install`.
4. Start the development server with the command: `npm start`.
5. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to access the app.

## Games

### Pong Game

The Pong game is a classic arcade game where players control paddles to hit a ball back and forth. The goal is to prevent the ball from hitting the edges of the screen while trying to make the ball pass the opponent's paddle.

To play the Pong game, click on the "Pong Game" link in the navigation bar. Use the arrow keys or mouse to control the paddle.

### Snake Game

The Snake game is another classic arcade game where players control a snake that grows in length as it eats food. The goal is to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the snake's own body or the boundaries of the screen.

To play the Snake game, click on the "Snake Game" link in the navigation bar. Use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction.

## File Structure

The project's file structure is as follows:

- `src/App.tsx`: This is the main component that sets up the navigation bar and routes for the games.
- `src/components/SnakeGame.tsx`: This file contains the implementation of the Snake game.
- `src/components/PongGame.tsx`: This file contains the implementation of the Pong game.
